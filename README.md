# Tic-tac-toe
## Running the game
 Clone the repository using a git manager or the terminal on your ide
 `git clone https://github.com/BenjaminGarza/Tic-tac-toe.git` 

 Open the file location in the terminal 
 Using linux terminal run 'ruby main.rb'

 The game will start up and ask for player names

## Rules: 
Player 1 is X Player 2 is O
Players must try to get 3 in a row on a  3 by 3 grid
Players can win by having three across, up and down, or diagonally
If all spaces are full and there is no winner, the game will end in a stalemate

Input a move by specifying the desired coordinate, i.e. 1,1
The first coordinate will decide the row and the second will decide the column
For example: 1,1 will put the players character in the upper left quadrant
1,3 is the upper right 
3,1 is lower left

Good luck, have fun!
